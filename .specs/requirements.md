# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A web-based management tool for DockerMCPGateway that provides browser-based administration capabilities. The system offers MCP server listing, detailed inspection, configuration management, testing functionality, log monitoring, catalog-based installation, secure credential management, configuration import/export, BitwardenCLI integration, and authentication features.

4. IF an MCP server is stopped THEN the system SHALL display its status as "Stopped"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view detailed information about MCP servers, so that I can understand available tools and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an MCP server THEN the system SHALL display detailed server information
2. WHEN displaying the detail screen THEN the system SHALL show a list of available tools
3. WHEN displaying the detail screen THEN the system SHALL show server configuration information
4. WHEN displaying the detail screen THEN the system SHALL show server resource usage
5. WHEN the selected MCP server has status 'error' THEN the system SHALL display an error state indicator and detailed error information (message, timestamp, severity)
6. WHEN displaying the detail screen for an 'error' server THEN the system SHALL show suggested remediation steps and available recovery actions (retry, restart, view logs)
7. WHEN an administrator performs a recovery action THEN the system SHALL provide clear success/failure feedback and state transition behavior (e.g., error→running or error→stopped)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to modify MCP server configurations, so that I can manage tool selection and sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the configuration screen THEN the system SHALL display current configuration values
2. WHEN changing tool selection THEN the system SHALL save changes and apply them to the server
3. WHEN entering sensitive information THEN the system SHALL encrypt and securely store it
4. WHEN saving configuration THEN the system SHALL restart the MCP server to apply settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to test MCP server functionality, so that I can verify proper operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the test screen THEN the system SHALL display test interfaces for available tools
2. WHEN executing a tool THEN the system SHALL display execution results
3. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL display error details
4. WHEN viewing test history THEN the system SHALL display past test results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view MCP server logs, so that I can identify the cause of issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the log screen THEN the system SHALL display logs in real-time
2. WHEN selecting a log level THEN the system SHALL display only logs at or above the specified level
3. WHEN searching logs THEN the system SHALL display logs matching the search criteria
4. WHEN downloading logs THEN the system SHALL provide a log file

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to install MCP servers from a catalog, so that I can easily add new MCP servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the catalog screen THEN the system SHALL display a catalog of available MCP servers
2. WHEN selecting an MCP server THEN the system SHALL display detailed server information
3. WHEN clicking the install button THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 202 and start an asynchronous installation job
4. WHEN installation job is running THEN the UI SHALL show installation progress through job status polling or websocket updates
5. WHEN installation job completes successfully THEN the system SHALL add it to the installed list and display clear success state
6. WHEN installation job fails THEN the UI SHALL provide failure handling and recovery options including retry, cancel, and display error details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to securely manage sensitive information, so that I can protect API keys and tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering sensitive information THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store it
2. WHEN displaying sensitive information THEN the system SHALL mask it
3. WHEN BitwardenCLI is available THEN the system SHALL be able to retrieve sensitive information from Bitwarden
4. WHEN updating sensitive information THEN the system SHALL securely delete old information
5. WHEN managing keys and tokens THEN the system SHALL provide documented update/rotation procedures including how to rotate, timeline, and rollback procedures
6. WHEN rotating keys and tokens THEN the system SHALL provide verifiable secure deletion of old secrets with crypto-wipe or overwrite evidence and retained proof
7. WHEN accessing or modifying sensitive information THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logging including user identity, timestamp, action (view/update/delete), and retention/retention-policy

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to import/export MCP configurations, so that I can backup configurations and migrate to other environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking the export button THEN the system SHALL provide an MCP configuration JSON file for download
2. WHEN selecting an import file THEN the system SHALL validate the file contents
3. WHEN importing a valid configuration file THEN the system SHALL apply the configuration and update MCP servers
4. WHEN exporting configuration containing sensitive information THEN the system SHALL exclude or mask sensitive information
5. WHEN exporting configuration files THEN the system SHALL include an explicit schemaVersion field in the exported JSON file
6. WHEN importing configuration files THEN the system SHALL validate the schemaVersion field and enforce backward/forward compatibility rules as documented in the migration policy
7. WHEN importing files with unsupported schemaVersion THEN the system SHALL reject the import with clear error messages indicating the supported version range and migration path
8. WHEN performing import operations THEN the system SHALL provide a dry-run mode that validates the file fully and simulates applying changes without persisting them, returning detailed validation results
9. WHEN importing configuration files THEN the system SHALL enforce file size limits (e.g., maximum 10MB) and maximum item/count limits (e.g., maximum 1000 MCP servers) with explicit rejection behavior for oversized files
10. WHEN exporting configuration files THEN the system SHALL implement strict masking/exclusion policy for sensitive fields (API keys, tokens, passwords, certificates) and ensure they are never included in exported files
11. WHEN importing configuration files THEN the system SHALL verify that imports do not reintroduce unmasked secrets and reject files containing sensitive information in plain text
12. WHEN validation fails during import THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the specific validation failure, line number (if applicable), and suggested remediation steps
13. WHEN dry-run mode is executed THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive validation results including success/failure status, warnings, and detailed change preview without applying any modifications


1. WHEN accessing the system THEN the system SHALL display a login screen

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with valid credentials so that I can access my dashboard and secure functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN entering valid credentials THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN entering invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. IF BitwardenCLI is available THEN the system SHALL be able to use Bitwarden credentials

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start the system with DockerComposeV2, so that I can easily run the system in a local environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `docker compose up` THEN the system SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL make the WebUI accessible on the specified port
3. WHEN dependent services are not running THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN stopping the system THEN the system SHALL persist data
